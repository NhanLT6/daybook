yarn add --dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

**Environment Configuration:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
VITE_XERO_USERNAME=your-xero-email@example.com
VITE_XERO_PASSWORD=your-xero-password
VITE_XERO_CONTACT_NAME=Your Contact Name in Xero

```

**Windows Desktop Shortcuts (Optional):**

Run the PowerShell setup script:

### Xero Automation Workflow

The automation process works as follows:

1. **Log your tasks** in the Daybook application
2. **Export to CSV** using the export button
3. **Run Xero automation** using either:

   - Manual command: `yarn test:e2e xeroWorkLogger.spec.ts`

The automation will:
- Open Xero in a browser
